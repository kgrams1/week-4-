#Algorithm workbench #3
#asked to write a for loop that displays the numbers 10,0,30 - 1000
#for a for loop you put for the x in range which specifies that you want it to loop from a specific chosen number being 0 to another number being 1000, then the number after the 1000 specifies the number of increase between each time the code loops so 10. This causes the code to loop by intervals of 10 all the way to 1000
for x in range(0, 1000, 10):
    print(x)
